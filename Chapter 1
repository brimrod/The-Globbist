That chainsaw isn't  ever going to  start, but  they won't stop trying. Over and over. The heat, the sun. My head. I'm out there with them now, supervising. There's a manual pole saw on the truck. It's just a sapling for fuck's sake. I remove the cutting head from the attachment and bend down. In less then 30 seconds I'm done. They pull the fallen tree across the grass and feed it into the chipper. I see the baseball--white and clean. The game can now continue.  They pick up the ball and replace it with a marker.  All runners advance one base and the ball is thrown hard at my face. I don't have a mitt. I duck and it sails over the fence. One run is in; Two runs are in. The game is over and we lose. The uniforms are collected on the field. It start to snow. My shoes are flapping as I walk through the slush. 

On the bus now. I see my stop and pull the cord. The bus speeds up and enters the freeway, almost tipping over taking the entrance ramp too fast. I feel the acceleration and then we leave the ground. Beautiful take-off. Then the big left turn. Out the window I'm looking straight down at the celebratory bonfires on the baseball field. The plane breaks through the dark clouds into bright sunshine and levels off.  They bring me a cocktail and I fall asleep.
